# 📊 Churn Prediction Using KNN

This project builds a **customer churn prediction model** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification algorithm. Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to identify customers at risk of leaving and to design effective retention strategies.

## 📝 Project Overview

The workflow includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Feature scaling for distance-based modeling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Analyzing churn patterns and feature correlations
- **Model Training:**  
  - Applying KNN to classify customer churn
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Measuring performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- **Prediction:**  
  - Predicting churn on new/unseen data

## 🚀 Features

✅ One-hot encoding of categorical columns  
✅ Scaling features to ensure fair distance calculations  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value of **K**  
✅ Visual evaluation of model performance  
✅ Clear, reproducible code and examples
